## 10/6/2025 - Did the schematic  

Decent progress, created the schematic based on the QFN60 version of RP2350. There is no external flash as I will most likely be using RP2354, which has 2MB onboard flash and _should_ be enough space. I will probably clean up the schematic first, then route the PCB.
