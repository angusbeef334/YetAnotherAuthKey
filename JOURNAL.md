## 10/6/2025 - Did the schematic  

Decent progress, created the schematic based on the QFN60 version of RP2350. There is no external flash as I will most likely be using RP2354, which has 2MB onboard flash and _should_ be enough space. I will probably clean up the schematic first, then route the PCB.

## 11/1/2025 - Routed the PCB  

Switched to a USB-A plug because it's easier to work with and the computer I will use it on has a type A port.

Routed the PCB, rerouted the PCB, and then rerouted it again.

I made the fabrication outputs and finished the GitHub repo.

The final costs are attached below, I will be soldering the board myself.

All prices in USD, totals to less than $30.
